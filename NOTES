prototype-based OO
    - cloning promitives (blocks, integers, etc.)
        - it looks like blocks have metaclasses, which is all I've ever
          "cloned" in Atomo (for @in-context); that's good enough for me
          if the rest isn't doable

calling a block with too few arguments should error

investigate symbol/particle/instance variable syntax

likely to be sacrificed:
    - objects as scope
